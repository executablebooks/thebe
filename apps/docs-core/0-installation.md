# Installation

`thebe-core` is available from npm as an `esm` or `commonjs` module and as a bundled package with typescript types.

`thebe-core` is primarily intended for use in a web application using a bundler such as `webpack` or `esbuild` but can also be directly loaded and used in the browser.

Install via npm:

```bash

```

And import classes and types directly in your code.

Or load the `thebe-core` bundle in your browser:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/thebe-core@latest/dist/lib/thebe-core.min.js"></script>
