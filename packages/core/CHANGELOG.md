## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- dad3d19: The refresh function has been removed and the beahviour of render and reset tweaked to remove the hideWidgets option. This means that `stripWidgets` is no longer called and the consumer must implement any functionality to manipulate MimeBundles that contain `ipywidgets`, if they want to achieve better default rendering. `stripWidgets` and the defualt `placeholder` generation functions have been exposed on the `thebe-core` apip to make this easier.
